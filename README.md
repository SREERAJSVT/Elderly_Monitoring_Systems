Elderly monitoring systems collect a range of data like movement , behavioral and sleep patterns,

Connect the ESP32 to the MAX30102 sensor using I2C communication. The MAX30102 is a pulse oximeter and heart rate sensor, so it can be used to measure a patient's heart rate and oxygen saturation levels.
Connect the ESP32 to the NEO 6M GPS module using UART communication. The NEO 6M GPS module can be used to determine the location of the patient.
Connect the ESP32 to the MPU6050 module using I2C communication. The MPU6050 is an accelerometer and gyroscope, so it can be used to measure a patient's movement and position.
Write a program for the ESP32 that collects data from the MAX30102, NEO 6M GPS module, and MPU6050. The program should store the data in a database or cloud storage solution.
Create a user interface that allows healthcare professionals to access the data collected by the patient monitoring system. This can be done using a web application or mobile app.

Create a user interface that allows healthcare professionals to access the data collected by the patient monitoring system. This can be done using a web application.
To create a user interface for healthcare professionals to access the data collected by the patient monitoring system, you can create a web application using a programming language such as JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
Here is a general outline of the steps you can follow to create a web application that displays the data stored in a cloud storage solution:
Set up a web server to host the web application. This can be done using a service such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.
Use JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to design the user interface for the web application. The interface should include elements such as charts, tables, and graphs to visualize the data collected by the patient monitoring system.
Use a programming library or API provided by the cloud storage solution to retrieve the data from the database and display it in the user interface. For example, if you are using Firebase as the cloud storage solution, you can use the Firebase Realtime Database API to fetch the data and the FirebaseUI library to display the data in the user interface.
Deploy the web application to the web server and make it accessible to healthcare professionals.
